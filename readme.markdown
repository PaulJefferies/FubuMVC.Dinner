What is FubuMVC?
--
FubuMVC is an open-source compositional, convention-based framework for building complex web applications. Based on a "Front Controller" pattern-style MVC framework it is designed for use in web applications built on ASP.NET.

To learn more about FubuMVC head on over to the [FubuMVC website](http://mvc.fubu-project.org).

What is FubuMVC.Dinner?

FubuMVC has a thriving community that is not only dedicated to the continued development of the framework but also devotes it's time to support and documentation; this application is an effort to demonstrate how you might develop a web application "the Fubu way".

The concept for this demo application is an intentional mirror of the [open source ASP.NET project](http://nerddinner.codeplex.com/) ["nerddinner"](http://www.nerddinner.com) created to aid adoption of MS MVC. My intention is to show how implementation of the same concept might differ between the two frameworks, although it is important to note this reflects just one of the many possible FubuMVC implementations.

It is my intention this repository will build against the latest release of FubuMVC to ensure it is current and a working source of reference.

Isn't there already a FubuDinner?

Yes! Chad Myers created [fubudinner](https://github.com/chadmyers/fubudinner) but understand it to be very much based on an early version whose features have since matured and grown exponentially. After some discussion with Jeremy D. Miller I decided to attempt a new version that embraced many of the new features and usage scenarios, if for no other reason then a learning exercise for myself.
